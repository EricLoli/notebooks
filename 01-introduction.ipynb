      "hypertext came out of the cupboard. In the late 1980s, Bill\n",

      "it was a matter of finding the correct approach to implementing\n",

      "proposition, but this was impractical for a number of reasons. To\n",
      "start with, any hypertext tool to be used worldwide would have to\n",
      "take into account that many types of computers existed that were\n",
      "linked to the Internet: Personal Computers, Macintoshes, UNIX\n",
      "machines and simple terminals. Also, many desktop publishing methods\n",
      "were in vogue: SGML, Interleaf, LaTex, Microsoft\n",
      "Word, and Troff among many others. Commercial hypertext packages\n",
      "were computer-specific and could not easily take text from other\n",
      "sources; besides, they were far too complicated and involved tedious\n",
      "compiling of text into internal formats to create the final\n",
      "hypertext system.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was needed was something very simple, at least in the\n",

      "Tim bases his HTML on an existing internationally agreed upon\n",
      "method of text mark-up\n",
      "The HTML that Tim invented was strongly based on SGML (Standard\n",
      "Generalized Mark-up Language), an internationally agreed upon method\n",
      "for marking up text into structural units such as paragraphs,\n",
      "headings, list items and so on. SGML could be implemented on any\n",
      "machine. The idea was that the language was independent of the\n",
      "formatter (the browser or other viewing software) which actually\n",
      "displayed the text on the screen. The use of pairs of tags such as\n",
      "<TITLE> and </TITLE> is taken directly\n",
      "from SGML, which does exactly the same. The SGML elements used in\n",
      "Tim's HTML included P (paragraph); H1 through\n",
      "H6 (heading level 1 through heading level 6); OL\n",
      "(ordered lists); UL (unordered lists); LI (list\n",
      "items) and various others. What SGML does not include, of course,\n",
      "are hypertext links: the idea of using the anchor element with the\n",

      "`www.name.name' format for addressing machines on the Web.\n",
